            <h2>Does conquering numerous mountains equate to the ultimate success?</h2>
            <p>
                How can we determine the number of mountains? It's impossible to count them all, no matter how
                experienced you are. Even though there are fewer mountains than stars, we can't measure success solely
                based on the number of mountains we've experienced.

                My ultimate goal isn't to conquer every peak or achieve something grandiose; it's a simple and serene
                dream. I aspire to find a job that brings me joy and fulfillment. Once I have enough financial stability
                for the year, I envision being able to care for a beloved companion and provide for their needs. I have
                a strong affinity for cats due to their peaceful and quiet nature, and I see many similarities between
                their traits and my own. Oh, it would be great if they're Persian breed.

            <h2>Is that all?</h2>
            <p>Of course not. The world is changing; nothing lasts forever. In the future, I may have more goals to
                challenge. But for now, I've run out of ideas :D. You know, there are various types of mountains that I
                haven't conquered.</p>
