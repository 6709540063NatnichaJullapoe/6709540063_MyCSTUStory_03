        <h2>Have you planned for four years in university yet?</h2>
        <p>Comparing planning for four years in university to climbing a mountain. If you want to reach the highest peak of a mountain, you should start by climbing from the lowest point. The faster you go, the more at risk you are. The peak is our goal, there's no need to rush, take it slowly, and enjoy the view.</p>

            <h3>First-year</h3>
            <p>As a freshman, I am still new and have less experience. Therefore, I should focus on learning a basic
                programming language. I want to not only learn new things but also improve my skills further.
                I am looking forward to participating in interesting activities from now on.</p>

        <section class="second_year">
            <h3>Second-year</h3>
            <p>Despite growing up in a second year, I still want to study for more knowledge. Until then I may enjoy
                using my free time for relaxing instead of doing something more productive and beneficial to my future.

            <h3>Third-year</h3>
            <p>After the time has passed for two years, I think planning to do a project is a good head start for my
                future career.</p>

        <section class="fourth_year">
            <h3>Fourth-year</h3>
            <p>Finally, the last year. I would mostly spend time on a project with my friends. In addition, I would set
                a plan to study at the university for a master's degree before I graduate.</p>

        <h2>
            Do you really reach the peak?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Although you have reached one peak, there are still many more peaks of varying heights around you. Set a new goal to reach a higher peak and strive to achieve it. Even if you fall, remember that you will rise again with more experience.
